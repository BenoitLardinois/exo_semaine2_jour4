We have an array with handles from Twitter and we will treat them.
1) With the method '.length' we know the numbers of handles in this array.
2) With the method '.min_bt' + (&:length), we know who is the shortest handle in this array.
3) With the method '.count' (we know the numbers of handles in this array) we stock the result in a variable 'item' and with the method '.length' we know how many handles contains 5 characters.
4) We create a variable(capital_letters) which takes value ("A".."Z"). With the method '.count' we stock the result in a variable 'x' and with capital_letters + the method '.include?(x[1])we know how many begin with a capital letter.
5) With the method '.sort_by' + (&:downcase) we sort the handle list alphabetically.

7) With the method '.index' + ('@epenser') we know exactly where the handle '@epenser' is.
